# OIDC SSO

Configure **OpenID Connect (OIDC) / OAuth2** single sign-on so operators log in with Azure AD, Okta, Google, Keycloak, or any OIDC-compliant IdP. The same configuration also enables SSO in the **official RustDesk desktop client** (stock Pro-style account login).

---

## Overview

- Optional — local username/password login remains available unless disabled
- Panel login at **http://your-server:5000**
- Desktop client login via API server (typically port **21114** / **21121**) when OIDC is enabled
- IdP callback handled by the Go server API (typically port **21114** or **21121** in Docker)
- Session cookie created by the Node.js panel after callback (same host/port as the login page)
- Supports **PKCE** (recommended) and automatic issuer discovery

---

## Configuration (Settings → Authentication → OIDC)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Enable OIDC** | Show SSO button on login page |
| **Identity provider** | Preset or custom |
| **Button display name** | e.g. "Sign in with Azure AD" |
| **Issuer URL** | OIDC issuer (`.well-known/openid-configuration` fetched automatically) |
| **Allowed private OIDC networks** | Optional comma-separated RFC1918/IPv6 ULA IPs or CIDRs for an on-premises/DMZ IdP (for example `10.20.0.0/16`); empty keeps private destinations blocked |
| **Client ID** | OAuth2 client ID from your IdP |
| **Client secret** | OAuth2 client secret |
| **Redirect URL** | Must match IdP exactly — path `/api/auth/oidc/callback` (or `/api/oidc/callback`). **Preferred:** your panel public URL (e.g. `https://your-server:5443/api/auth/oidc/callback`) — the console proxies the callback to Go. Direct Go/Client API (`:21114` / `:21121`) also works. |
| **Panel URL** | URL operators use to open the web console — e.g. `http(s)://your-server:5000` or your reverse-proxy hostname. **Required** when callback runs on the Go API port (Docker, split-port installs). Auto-filled from the browser when you save settings. |
| **Scopes** | Default `openid profile email` |
| **Use PKCE** | Recommended for public clients |
| **Auto provisioning** | Create local user on first SSO login (if enabled) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using HTTPS behind a reverse proxy, set `TRUST_PROXY=true` in `.env` so redirect URLs and cookies use the correct scheme.

> [!WARNING]
> Private-network access is an explicit exception to the default SSRF protection. Add only the exact IdP address or smallest required CIDR. Loopback, link-local, multicast, unspecified, and metadata addresses remain blocked even when an allowlist is configured. The allowlist applies to discovery, token, and UserInfo requests and is also enforced after redirects.

You can also set **`PANEL_PUBLIC_URL`** in the console `.env` as a fallback panel origin for OIDC session redirects.

## Docker / split-port note

| Port | Typical use |
|------|-------------|
| **21114** | Default Go API (native install / split Docker). OIDC callback may use `http(s)://host:21114/api/auth/oidc/callback`. |
| **21121** | All-in-one Docker Go API / RustDesk Client API (or Node → Go proxy). OIDC callback may use `http(s)://host:21121/api/auth/oidc/callback`. |
| **5000** / **5443** | Web console. **Also valid** as Redirect URL host after #304 — panel proxies `/api/auth/oidc/callback` to Go. Set **Panel URL** to this origin. |

When TLS terminates on Caddy/Nginx with a **single hostname**, prefer Redirect URL `https://your-host/api/auth/oidc/callback` on the panel (or route that path to Go). The panel proxy keeps pending RustDesk client OIDC state on the Go process.

---

## Reverse proxy (single hostname)

When TLS terminates on Caddy/Nginx, use one public hostname and route:

| Path | Upstream |
|------|----------|
| `/api/auth/oidc/callback` | Node panel (`127.0.0.1:5000`) **or** Go API — panel proxies to Go |
| `/api/auth/oidc/session` | Node panel (`127.0.0.1:5000`) |
| `/` (everything else) | Node panel (`127.0.0.1:5000`) |

Set **Redirect URL** to `https://your-host/api/auth/oidc/callback` and **Panel URL** to `https://your-host`.

See [REVERSE_PROXY.md](../setup/REVERSE_PROXY.md).

## IdP setup checklist

1. Register a new OAuth2/OIDC application in your IdP
2. Set redirect URI to match BetterDesk (see **Redirect URL** in Settings)
3. Copy Client ID and Client Secret into the panel
4. Set **Panel URL** to the console origin operators use
5. Enable PKCE if your IdP supports it
6. Test login from the panel login page

---

## User mapping

- First SSO login may create a user (if auto-provisioning enabled)
- If auto-provisioning is **disabled**, users must exist in BetterDesk first — otherwise login fails with `oidc_no_account`
- Map IdP groups to server roles manually after first login (or via future automation)

---

## RustDesk desktop client (#304)

Official RustDesk clients already support OIDC when the API server advertises it. BetterDesk reuses the **same** OIDC settings as the panel (no second IdP app required if the Redirect URL is reachable from the browser).

### How it works

1. Client calls `GET /api/login-options` → receives `["", "oidc/<Display name>"]` when OIDC is enabled
2. Client calls `POST /api/oidc/auth` → opens the returned IdP URL in the system browser
3. After IdP login, the browser hits the **Redirect URL** (`…/api/auth/oidc/callback`). Panel origins are proxied to Go; API ports hit Go directly
4. Client polls `GET /api/oidc/auth-query` until it receives an `access_token`

### Operator checklist

1. Configure OIDC under **Settings → Authentication → OIDC** (same as panel)
2. Set IdP **Redirect URL** to a valid callback path — easiest: `https://<panel-host>/api/auth/oidc/callback` (must match Settings exactly)
3. Point the RustDesk client **API server** at the BetterDesk Client API (often `:21121` or your reverse-proxy API URL)
4. Open Login in RustDesk — an SSO button appears next to username/password
5. After IdP sign-in, the browser should show **Sign-in successful** (not a panel 404). Then the client leaves “Waiting…”

If the client stays on **Waiting…** after IdP login, the callback almost certainly never reached Go (wrong Redirect URL / 404). Check the browser page and `curl` the Redirect URL path on the host you registered in the IdP.

Accounts bound to OIDC still cannot use a local password in the desktop client (use the SSO button). LDAP/AD password login remains available for directory accounts.

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Client stuck on **Waiting…** after IdP | Callback never reached Go (e.g. panel 404 before proxy fix) | Update panel; use Redirect URL ending in `/api/auth/oidc/callback`; confirm browser shows “Sign-in successful” |
| SSO button opens `http://localhost:21114/api/auth/oidc/authorize` | Older panel versions redirected the browser to the internal Go API URL | Update the panel; authorize is resolved server-to-server and the browser goes straight to the IdP |
| `Invalid or missing credentials` (JSON) | Browser hit Go API for `/api/auth/oidc/session` instead of the panel | Set **Panel URL** in OIDC settings (or `PANEL_PUBLIC_URL`); use reverse-proxy path rules |
| `oidc_invalid` | State/nonce mismatch or bad auth code | Retry; check clock sync |
| `oidc_denied` | User cancelled or IdP denied | IdP policy / consent |
| `oidc_failed` | Token exchange failed | Verify client secret, redirect URL |
| `oidc_no_account` | User not in BetterDesk | Create user or enable auto-provisioning |
