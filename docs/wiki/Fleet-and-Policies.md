# Fleet and Policies

Manage large device estates with **Fleet** grouping, **access policies**, and **unattended access** schedules.

---

## Fleet management

The **Fleet** page provides batch-oriented device operations:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Device groups** | Organize peers by tags, folders, or fleet definitions |
| **Batch actions** | Apply operations to multiple devices |
| **Scaling view** | Capacity and connection metrics for large deployments |
| **Inventory** | Hardware/software inventory from client sysinfo |

Fleet tools complement per-device actions on the **Devices** page. Use folders for operator UX; use fleet builder for scripted or bulk workflows.

---

## Access policies

Access policies store **inventory and scheduling metadata** for a device (panel / Go API). They do **not** replace the RustDesk peer password handshake and are **not enforced at connect time** on punch/relay today.

| Policy element | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Schedule** | Recorded time windows for unattended access (metadata) |
| **Operator restrictions** | Stored allowlist of operators (not enforced on peer connect yet) |
| **Device password** | Bcrypt hash of the unattended password (inventory / reference) |
| **Approval** | Notes attended vs unattended intent — target client config still applies |

Configure under **Policies** in the web panel or via Go API:

```bash
curl http://server:21114/api/access-policies \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key"
```

See [[API Reference|API-Reference]] for CRUD endpoints.

## Unattended access

Two separate steps — both are required for hands-off remote access:

1. **On the target:** configure RustDesk for unattended access (permanent password via `--password`, client Security settings, or BetterDesk Agent Client / Support Agent unattended mode). Without this, the peer still prompts for a temporary password or on-screen approval.
2. **In BetterDesk (optional inventory):** record schedule / notes under Access Policy. Access Policy bcrypt hashes are **inventory only** and cannot auto-fill connect.
3. **Org preset vault (#367, optional):** Organizations → Address Book → contact → **Set password**. The plaintext is stored **encrypted (AES-256-GCM)** in the main BetterDesk database (`org_peer_credentials` on SQLite or PostgreSQL), never in shared AB JSON. On `GET /api/ab`, authorized members receive a runtime `password` field for stock RustDesk shared-AB style auto-use; Web Remote can fetch `/api/devices/:id/connect-password` to pre-fill. Set the same permanent password on the workstation. Prefer env `ORG_PEER_VAULT_KEY` (falls back to JWT secret).

Operators still complete the **target peer password** handshake. By default, BetterDesk account login and device-group membership control **visibility** (address book / ACL) and audit attribution — not passwordless peer connect. For account-bound outbound initiation, enable `LOGGED_IN_ONLY_INITIATOR=Y` (or **Settings → Connection → Require client login for initiators**); then stock RustDesk clients also need an active BetterDesk client session before starting PunchHole/relay. This does not replace the target password/approve handshake or enforce a per-operator-to-device ACL. Anyone who can see a vaulted contact may receive the preset for connect.

Wake-on-LAN for offline devices: device kebab menu → **Wake on LAN** (requires known MAC).

## Scoped remote users

Org-scoped and role-scoped users see only devices assigned to them. See [[Organizations and RBAC|Organizations-and-RBAC]] for tenant isolation.
